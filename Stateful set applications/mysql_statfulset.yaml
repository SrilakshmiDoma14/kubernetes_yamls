#A stateful application saves data about each client session that occurs and
#holds on to that data until the next time the client issues a request. The
#data which is saved is known as the state of the app, hence the term
#stateful. How is that data stored? Either locally or on a remote host until
#the time at which the user logs out, or following a predetermined amount of
#time when the session is set to expire.

#A stateless application, by contrast, is an application program that
#doesnâ€™t save client data generated in one session for use in the next with
#the same client. HTTP, for instance, is inherently stateless. This means
#that when a state is desired for a web app, stateful features need to be
#built in with dynamic pages. The pages can store sessions via web address
#variables and server and client-side stored data, such as via cookies.
