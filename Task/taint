You add a taint to a node using kubectl taint. For example,

kubectl taint nodes node1 key=value:NoSchedule

places a taint on node node1. The taint has key key, value value, and taint
effect NoSchedule. This means that no pod will be able to schedule onto node1
unless it has a matching toleration.

To remove the taint added by the command above, you can run:

kubectl taint nodes node1 key:NoSchedule-

In-order to launch POD with the matched taint:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    env: test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  tolerations:
  - key: "example-key"
    operator: "Exists"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
